std::time_t
localtime()
asctime()
ctime()

Algorithm:
	Retrieve and display the current time and date.

Debug:
	Compiling the program results in success. Cannot use mktime() function because it returns a
'segmentation fault' after running the program. After debugging the program it returns this error:
	.time/mktime.c: No such file or directory

	You can pretty much search online and lookup any number programs in c++ similar to this one 
that is being created.	

##NOTE: ctime(), gmtime(), localtime() functions all take an argument of data type tim_t
	which represents calendar time.

##NOTE: asctime(), mktime() functions both take an argument representing broken-down time,
	which is a representation separated into year, month, day, and so on.

##FIXME: While using localtime() function to display the time and date it returns only
a hexadecimal number.

##FIXME: If I were to use mktime() function it gives a segfault when run.
