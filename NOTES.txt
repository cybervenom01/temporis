ctime()

Algorithm:
	Retrieve and display the current time and date.

Debug:
	Compiling the program results in success. Cannot use mktime() function because it returns a
'segmentation fault' after running the program. After debugging the program it returns this error:
	.time/mktime.c: No such file or directory

	You can pretty much search online and lookup any number programs in c++ similar to this one 
that is being created.
