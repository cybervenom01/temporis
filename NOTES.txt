Read the file ctime

std::time_t
localtime()
asctime()
ctime()

Algorithm:
	Retrieve and display the current time and date.

Debug:

##FIXME: Using the mktime() function to get the time. Compiling the program results
	 in success. But running the program returns a segmentation fault error.
	 After debugging the program it returns this error message:

		.time/mktime.c: No such file or directory

##NOTE: I search on my computer for the file but find nothing. Searching online I
	find nothing. But I do find other similar programs made by other programmers.

##NOTE: ctime(), gmtime(), localtime() functions all take an argument of data type
	time_t which represents calendar time.

##NOTE: asctime(), mktime() functions both take an argument representing broken-down time,
	which is a representation separated into year, month, day, and so on.

##FIXME: While using localtime() function to display the time and date it returns
	 only a hexadecimal number.
